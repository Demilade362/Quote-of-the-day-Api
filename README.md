# Quote-of-the-day-Api

Create an API that provides a random quote every time a user makes a request to a specific endpoint. You can source quotes from various authors, books, movies, or famous personalities.

Here's a basic outline of how you can approach this:

## Collect Quote Data:

Gather a collection of quotes. You can manually curate a list of quotes or use public APIs that provide random quotes (like the They Said So Quotes API).

## Define API endpoints:

/quote - Fetches a random quote.
/quotes/:author - Retrieves quotes by a specific author if needed.
Create API Server:
Use a framework like Express.js (Node.js) or Flask (Python) to set up a server that handles incoming API requests.

## Serve Random Quotes:

Implement logic in your server to randomly select a quote from your collection and return it in response to requests to the /quote endpoint.

Handle Author-based Requests (Optional):
If you implement an endpoint for quotes by a specific author (/quotes/:author), ensure the API fetches and returns quotes by the specified author.

This project involves basic API creation, handling HTTP requests, and serving random content from a predefined dataset. It can be a fun way to learn about setting up APIs without dealing with complex data structures or external API integrations.
